# Panda3D Type Stubs
Within this repository are type stubs for the Python bindings of
[Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/) and the scripts to generate them.

It's still a work in progress, and the generation scripts can't be run with any
released version of Panda3D, but the stubs should be accurate enough to be
helpful. At the moment, doing this will require copying `panda3d-stubs` into
whatever directory is using Panda3D, but more streamlined installation methods
will be coming soon.
