# Switched off for all files:
#   E501: line too long
#         Stubs have a longer suggested maximum line length, and
#         the scripts here follow the 79-character limit loosely.

# Irrelevant for stub files:
#   E301: expected 1 blank line, found 0
#   E302: expected 2 blank lines, found 0
#   E305: expected 2 blank lines after end of function or class
#   E701: multiple statements on one line (colon)
#   F401: module imported but unused
#   F822: undefined name name in __all__

# Dictated by source, not stubs:
#   E741: do not use variables named 'l', 'O', or 'I'
#   F403: 'from module import *' used; unable to detect undefined names

# The auto-generated panda3d stubs don't conform to these rules:
#   Y021: Docstrings should not be included in stubs.
#   Y042: Type alias names should use CamelCase rather than snake_case.
#         Some of the enum aliases use snake_case to match the name of a class.

# The direct stubs don't conform to these rules:
#   Y011: All default values for typed function arguments must be '...'.
#         Currently, defaults are kept if they are singleton values.
#   Y014: All default values for arguments must be '...'.
#   Y037: Use PEP 604 syntax instead of 'typing.Union' and 'typing.Optional'.
#         This will be changed once some Mypy bugs are fixed.
